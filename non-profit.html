        <h4>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h4>
        <p>The Congo Tree is a youth development charity based in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the UK. They equip young people in DRC with transferable life and leadership skills, support them with mentoring and encourage them to get involved in their community.</p>
        <p>We conducted competitor analysis and used user research to learn more about pain points users faced when using TCT's existing website. The Congo Tree were excited to work with us and also shared their brand guidelines and some wishes for their website.</p>
        <h5>My responsibilities:</h5>
        <li>Aid in conducting user research</li>
        <li>Prototyping desktop wireframes (working alongside my group member creating the mobile wireframes)</li>
        <li>Carrying out user testing</li>
        <li>Iterating designs</li>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <h4>WHAT IS THE PROJECT ABOUT?</h4>
        <h5>The problem:</h5>
            <p>Users were confused about the information they were seeing on the website and unable to use it on a mobile device, as there was no existing responsive web design (RWD).
                Therefore, we aimed to improve information architecture, navigation and create a RWD solution.
                Our redesign of the Congo Tree website set out to achieve greater user engagement and allow the non-profit to share its values and goals with more users.</p>
        <h5>The attitude going into this:</h5>
            <p>It was important that we listen to both the user testing and stakeholders when redesigning TCT's website, especially since it is a relatively small organisation which operates in a developing country. This means we have to account for UX and UI design which can efficiently work when internet connectivity may be low, although, talking to stakeholders, things have improved since the first design but we still need to be cautious.</p>
            <p>Therefore, our design thinking was...</p>
            <div class="post-its">
              <p style="background-color: #96b45aff;">Honour the organisation's identiy and values</p>
              <p style="background-color: #96b45aff;">Find inpiration from other non-profits websites</p>
              <p style="background-color: #96b45aff;">Focus on accessibility and colours</p>
              <p style="background-color: #96b45aff;">Keeping the design simple yet unique and authentic</p>
            </div>
            
        <h4>HOW WAS THE RESEARCH DONE?</h4>
        <h5>Methodology:</h5>
            <p>We conducting a series of 6 usability tests on the existing Congo Tree website by testing four tasks...</p>

        <h5>Analysing the data:</h5>
            <p>From the usability testing we found several improvements and iterations that could be implemented in the re-design to enhance the user experience, these included...</p>

        <h2>Definition and Ideation</h2>
        <h4>READING THE USER'S MIND...</h4> 
        <!-- <h5>USER INSIGHT STATEMENT:</h5> -->
            <p>During user testing and interviews, we discovered that users were confused about the information they were seeing on the website and unable to read large chunks of it.</p>
            <p>Therefore, we believe that the website has poor information architecture and poor RWD when switching to mobile view. and that we might be able to help if we improve information architecture and create a RWD solution.</p>
        <h4>SO, WHAT FEATURES TO INCLUDE?</h4>
            <p>Using the I Like, I Wish, What If methodology, we collectively outlined the pain-points and needs discovered during the usability tesing and each voted on the most promising features.
            These included…</p>
            <div class="post-its">
              <p style="background-color: #96b45aff;">More subtle yet visible logo positioning</p>
              <p style="background-color: #96b45aff;">Better usability and visibility of the search bar</p>
              <p style="background-color: #96b45aff;">A more informative footer with appropiate links</p>
              <p style="background-color: #96b45aff;">More interactive elements on pages to engage the user</p>
            </div>
        <h4>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h4>
          <h5>The new user flow...</h5>
          <p>Given the existing information architecture and the journey the user has to take in order to complete the main task (getting involed with the charity) a new user flow was adapted before re-designing.</p>
          <img src="./Images/Non-profit/Non-profit-user-flow.svg" alt="user flow">

          <h5>The stakeholder's response</h5>
          <p><i>“Drop downs menus is one of our main needs. A translation toggle/button is also a want, and a more exciting front page too. I'm sure the others could come up with more. Thanks so much for thinking of us!”</i></p>
          <p style="font-weight: bold;">Q. Name 5 adjectives to describe your website.</p>
          <p><i>“youthful, creative, professional, inspirational, challenging (not to use, but in what it makes you think about - people going away still thinking about it - to think about us and still be thinking about us 30 mins later).”</i></p>
          <p style="font-weight: bold;">Q. How should a person feel when they see your website?</p>
          <p><i>“'oh my gosh this is actually really amazing, why am I not involved already!' - inspired, joyful, engaged.”</i></p>

        <h2>Prototyping</h2>
        <h4>COLLECTIVE BRAINSTORMING</h4>
        <p>To begin the design process, each of us came up with our own homepage designs for the desktop website, so that we could compare ideas and our reasons for implementing them.</p>
        <p>From this, we were then able to design the desktop homepage for The Congo Tree website, in addition to using this as template to create other web pages and RWD for mobile</p>
        <div class="section-container" style="background-color: rgb(150, 180, 90, 0.5);">

        <h2>Testing and Iterating</h2>
        <h4>TESTING THE NEW DESIGN...</h4>
            <p>We conducted a series of 5-second usability tests of the new design asksing different users to perform the same tasks we set for the first usability test (from the exisiting website).</p>
        <h5>Desktop iterations:</h5>
            <li>Used a familar layout from the exisiting website (identifying with the original content)</li>
            <li>A new navigation bar with a translucent logo scretched accross the background and hover effect</li>
            <li>Addition of a French to English, and vice-verse, toggle button in the navigation, as requested by stakeholders</li>
            <li>A subtly grey footer, as opposed to the yellow, as users expressed the colour being too harsh on the eyes</li>
        <h5>Mobile iterations:</h5>
            <p>Same interations as desktop, in addition to...</p>
            <li>Button at the end of the page (above the footer) to allowing immediate scroll back to the top with one click</li>
            <li>Addition of a search bar in the footer, quicker searching options as page length increases on mobile</li>
            <li>Main CTA on mobile is "Donate" as adding it to the navigation may hide it in the menu, unlike the desktop</li>
